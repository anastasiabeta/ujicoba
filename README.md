GitHub’s full year of 2023 transparency reporting data is now available on our transparency center and repository. This is our first data release since introducing the transparency center and now that we have an accessible, interactive, and easy to update platform for our transparency reporting, we will use these data release updates to share when we expand our reporting or find interesting insights in the data.
