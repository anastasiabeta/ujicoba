As shown above, we processed 365 notices that alleged circumvention in 2022 and 406 notices in 2023 compared to just 92 notices over the entire year of 2021. In terms of average notices per month, thatâ€™s more than four times the volume (7.67 per month in 2021 vs. 33.83 per month in 2023).

On September 29, 2021, we updated our DMCA takedown submission form with questions related to circumvention. We made this change because DMCA circumvention claims typically require more extensive review, and marking takedown requests as circumvention claims allows us to triage them appropriately.
